# R-Discord-Bot

This was a Discord bot that used RSelenium before support went out the window. 

RSelenium was used because I wanted to be able to see what I was doing better, though it could be done through curl or something else to be faster. 


The idea was I could get on discord with a bot and have it monitor various conversations and who posted, then respond if need be. This was mainly more proof of concept than something I would run all the time and keep up to date.
